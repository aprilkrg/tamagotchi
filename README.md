# Tamagotchi Pitch
<!-- https://hackmd.io/KEtIW1JYSEGS-3Mu78xN9A -->
## Description
The original life simulation game - Tamagotchi! The player creates and cares for a new pet character by responding to it's needs for food, play, and rest. Not meeting those needs will result in a game loss, but if you play long enough your character will evolve so work hard!

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- JAVASCRIPT
- CSS

## Wireframes

## MVP Goals
- user can create a tamagotchi character
- character starting stats are maxed out and display on screen
- user clicks button to start the game
- game automatically descreases characters stats
- user increases character stats by clicking coresponding buttons
- character avatar will evolve after a set time (win condition)
- character will devolve/die if any stat reaches 0 (lose condition)
- user is given a choice to reset the game after win or lose

## Stretch Goals
- user can set a name for their character
- display character avatar as an egg before user starts game

## Roadblocks
- keeping data if the user refreshes the page (not how the game should work but an interesting idea)

## Icebox
- decrease the characters stats more quickly/randomly
